Test tests can be improved in the following areas:
    1. Include more test data instead of just one user information and then test against different sets of user data
    2. Add some error handling scenarios for the functions. Right now we only have happy flows.
    3. More dynamic tests can be included for cases where we can request data for a perticular user. for eg: request age for given user "xyz"
